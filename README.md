# vadpcmbin-To-SoHAudioSample
## A tool to convert the vadpcm.bin files, created by z64audio.exe/z64rom, to the audio sample format that SoH, the Ocarina of Time PC Port , utilizes.

* Step 1: Open your wav file in audacity (audio editing tool) and modify the sample rate value to be the same as the sample rate of the audio you want to replace then go to `Effect->Pitch and Tempo->Change Speed and Pitch` and modify the speed value until it sounds approximately normal again. Also, to check what's the sample rate of the audio you want to replace is, use [z64rom](https://github.com/z64tools/z64rom) and compile OoT MQ Debug rom with it and then navigate to z64rom's `rom\sound\sample\.vanilla\[Audio]\` folder. You'll see a WAV file of the original sound in there. Open it with audacity and then you can see its sample rate value. sample rate value of audio samples in the game that I checked out were either 16000 Hz or 20000 Hz, so if you are unable to get z64rom to work, choose between 16000 Hz or 20000 Hz.
* Step 2: Use [z64audio](https://github.com/z64tools/z64audio/releases/tag/2.2.0) or z64rom to convert your WAV file to vadpcm.bin. It should create two files which are a .vadpcm.bin file and a config.toml file. Both of these are important. You can ignore/delete the .book.bin file.
* Step 3: Use vadpcmToSample to open the vadpcm.bin file (make sure the config.toml file is in the same folder as vadpcm.bin). The tool should automatically adjust the "loop end" value to be just long enough so the whole audio plays in-game.
* Step 4: make a folder somewhere in your PC (for example, a folder called "myaudio") and then make a folder inside it and name it "audio" and make a folder inside "audio" folder called "samples". Then place your custom audio sample in that folder and rename it to the name of the audio sample you want to replace. Finally, using [retro](https://github.com/HarbourMasters64/retro), navigate to "Create OTR" -> "Custom" -> "Select Directory" and select the "myaudio" folder, then select "Stage Files" -> "Finalize OTR" -> "generate OTR" and place the otr file in y=the "mods" folder in soh. If you don't know the name of the audio sample you want to replace, use mpq-editor (google it) and open your oot.otr (or oot-mq.otr) and navigate to `audio/samples/` folder. There, you can see the names of all the audio samples for SoH.

## Note(s):
* The audio will very likely sound kinda glitchy even after adjusting the sample rate and Hz value in audacity. At the moment i'm writing this, i still don't know what's the fix for this. The glitchy effects can be considered by some as somewhat minor though.

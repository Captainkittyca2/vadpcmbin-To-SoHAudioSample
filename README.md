# vadpcmbin-To-SoHAudioSample
A tool to convert the vadpcm.bin files, created by z64audio.exe/z64rom, to the audio sample format that SoH, the Ocarina of Time PC Port , utilizes.

* Step 1: Open your wav file in audacity (audio editing tool) and modify the sample rate value to be the same as the sample rate of the audio you want to replace then go to `Effect->Pitch and Tempo->Change Speed and Pitch` and modify the speed value until it sounds approximately normal again. Also, to check what's the sample rate of the audio you want to replace is, use z64rom[https://github.com/z64tools/z64rom] and compile OoT MQ Debug rom with it and then navigate to z64rom's `rom\sound\sample\.vanilla\[Audio]\` folder. You'll see a WAV file of the original sound in there. Open it with auacity and then you can see its sample rate value.
